## Magento 2 site-wide customer facing announcements

Easily add personalised customer messages to your magento store. Customised annoucements, greetings, discounts, upsells, crossells, testimonials, banners, hero images and more. Find the comment for the placeholder code in markup and go from there. This is framework to allow you to deliver personalised repeating CMS content which meet certain conditions on the frontend.

With marketing section in backend configure message groups with the following:

    * Required

  - Name *
  - Position in site
  - CSS class
  - Status * 
  - Store View * 
  - Only visible to customer email
  - Only visible to customer group
  - Visible date from
  - Visible date to
  - Sort
  - Limit
  - Message sort by *

Then attach one or more messages to this group with the following:

    * Required

  - Name *
  - CSS class
  - Sort
  - Associated Group ID *
  - Status *
  - Content

Messages are rendered on the frontend based on configuration.

I use magento registry to restrict impatch of queries.
